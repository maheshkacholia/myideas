#properties file aloway gives constant value which you don't want to hard code in your application . 
The idea is about providing dynanic value by some scripting support or java code call within property file so that same processing is not require to be done at program 
level
use case 
we need to create multiple properties file for each environment dev,test,qa,prod etc . why not one and that property file returns value automatically based on env 
 this way we don't have to manange multiple properties where only couple of properties changes based on env 
 
 use case 2
 we have a common utility where based on consumer we want to span our thread accoringly . like some premium client should have more thread for processing and 
 non premium less . 
 
 based on country or any other parameter  we want to set time 
 
 here is tradition approach . 
 
 
 appp_dev.proprties
 app.url=http://dev.com
 app.name=myapp
 
 appp_qa.proprties
 app.url=http://qa.com
 app.name=myapp
 
 trad code 
 
 String env = System.getEnv();
 
 Properties p = new Properties ();
 if(env=dev) {
 p.load(app_dev.properties);
 }
 if(env=qa){
 p.load(app_qa.properties);
 }
 
 dynamic properties 
 
 app.properties 
 app.name=myapp
 String env = System.getEnv();
 if(env=dev){
 app.url=http://dev.com
 }
 if(env=qa){
 app.url=http://qa.com
 }
 
 code
  Properties p = new Properties ();
  p.load(DynamicProperty.load(app.properties );
  
  this will keep all properties related if else code into property itself and will reduce multiple properties or code where based on properties value
  we need to programitiacally change value 
  
  in this example if new env need to added we need to make chnage in property file not in code
